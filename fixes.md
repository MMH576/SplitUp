Things to fix and  MAke the most appropriate fix without breaking the app. Do all of these carefully and slowly and ask me any questions if u r confused about anything: 

1- when new user/existing is signed up/in a blank plank appears and the features only appear after the page is refreshed
2 - when two friends are added, both users have the same name in the friend section. For example if mohammed adds tonmoy then it says mohammed in both user screens instead of each others names
3 - in the friend section the frind u have must have their profile picture displayed in the profile. If no picture then just the first letter of their name in the picture
4- In a group only the person who created the expense can edit/delete the expense, not even the admin can change that. In the current version it seems like all members can delete or edit an expense create by anothe rindividual..
5- in the group the person who owes money to an expense should see an indicator on the expenses section to show how much they owe the person who created he expense.
6- in the group section, the person who created an expense should see clearly that they are the creators of that expense and how much money they are expecting to get from the members the user mentioned to pay them.
7- in the group section once everyone pays up the full amount on that expense it should indicate it in the expense section.
8 - in the expense section only show the user how much they owe in that expense and if they click to view the details they can see the toal amount and othe rinfo. And if the person who created the expense should see the total in their expense section.
9 - (VERY IMPORTANT) any changes made in the group csections must be made for individual friend sections as well but appropriately
10 - MARK PAID should be updated by the one who paid to the guy and the guy receiving the money must be notified after the person who paid marks paid and after the receiving guy checks if he got the money he can confirm the mark paid coming form the sender
11- groups and friends must be separated in the dashboard clearly
